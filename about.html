  <h2>About Our Organic Farming Initiative</h2>
  <p>
    Our project is driven by a commitment to uphold the foundational values of organic agriculture. We embrace centuries-old organic farming practices along with new scientific knowledge of ecological farming. We believe that crops grown in soil and livestock raised on pasture-based systems are fundamental to organic farming. Healthy soils lead to healthy crops and livestock, which in turn support healthy people and a healthy climate.
  </p>
  <p>
    The recent shift towards hydroponics and the relaxation of animal welfare rules have led many to feel that the traditional organic label no longer reflects their farming practices. Our community has worked tirelessly to build a label that people can trust. While much about the National Organic Program is a success, the inclusion of products from a minority of large industrial operations has been at odds with the original intent of organic farming.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our mission is to grow people's understanding of organic values and practices, creating an add-on label to USDA certified organic to provide more transparency on these farming practices. We respect the inspections conducted by certifying agencies that adhere to soil fertility requirements, and we aim to ensure that our certification process reflects our dedication to real organic farming.
